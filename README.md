# Horiseon 
 In this project I found and corrected the mistakes that I found in html and as well as css. What I did was found the problems that were apearing on the browser that was not letting it look good when opened.I removed divs that did not need to be there and instead were repleced with header or classes. I also added the missing alt tags from after the image link. I also fixed the footer and as well as removed the extra classes in css that did not need to be more than 1 to control the margin and color.
